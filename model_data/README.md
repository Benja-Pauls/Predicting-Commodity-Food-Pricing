This folder is dedicated to hosting data that will be utilized by the model. While the form-factor of the model_data may vary as more experiments are conducted, each will be a csv containing un-numericalized data with both input(s) and output columns for each training instance (row).

Each folder within this `model_data` directory contains data all of the same format. The title of the sub-directories should be descriptive of the data contained within.
