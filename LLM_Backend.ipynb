    "# Commodity Food Pricing: Chatbot LLM\n",
    "\n",
    "**By:** `MSOE AI-Club \"Nourish\" Student Research Team`<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notebook Purpose:** This notebook provides the code implementation of a Large Language Model (LLM) with an algorithm developed for the application of providing context to the severity warnings of commodity food prices. This algorithm receives great responses for a question-thought-response framework with an open-source LLM Llama.cpp (https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp).\n",
    "\n",
    "Llama.cpp was chosen as a demonstrative experiment due to its small size (allowing it to be run on many consumer-grade hardware), Llama's proficiency in chat-bot related tasks, and its small size due to its implementation in C/C++ without the use of external ML/Tensor libraries. Lessoning the amount of external libraries used also increases the security of this system.\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm has been proven to work using a basic T4 (\"teaching\") node on the [MSOE ROSIE Supercomputer](https://www.msoe.edu/about-msoe/news/details/meet-rosie/)."

You can read more about temperature [here](https://medium.com/@lazyprogrammerofficial/what-is-temperature-in-nlp-llms-aa2a7212e687).\n",

    "* **RESPONSE_FILTER_LLM_SYSTEM_CONFIG:** The \"system prompt\" for the main llm responsible for filtering the user's questions in the case that they're deemed inappropriate for the main communicative chat bot to respond to. A system prompt is the \"back story\" of a model and is the main way to alter the behavior of the LLM.\n",
