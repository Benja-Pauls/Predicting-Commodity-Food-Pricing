# Predicting-Commodity-Food-Pricing
MAIC Research Group 1 (2023-2024 cohort) of 8 students from Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE) working together with two professors to develop an AI algorithm to predict commodity food pricing.

## Cloning Repo On Rosie
You can also clone this repo locally, but it will be beneficial to have this repo on Rosie to utilize the computational power.
1. Navigate to the [Rosie Dashboard](https://dh-ood.hpc.msoe.edu/pun/sys/dashboard/)
2. Navigate to "Clusters" and then ">_Rosie Shell Access"
3. Navigate to your desired folder to clone the repo into
4. Clone repo via ssh: `git clone git@github.com:Benja-Pauls/Predicting-Commodity-Food-Pricing.git`

## Data Folder Setup
1. Create a directory within the project called `data`. This repo is setup to ignore a `data` folder when tracking changes.<br>
2. Download data into the `data` folder from one of the following options<br>
    1. Download dataset from kaggle for early experimenting: [Global Food Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jboysen/global-food-prices)

    2. Download the data we hopefully have access to from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)
