4. Clone repo via ssh: `git clone git@github.com:Benja-Pauls/Predicting-Commodity-Food-Pricing.git`

## Data Folder Setup
1. Create a directory within the project called `data`. This repo is setup to ignore a `data` folder when tracking changes.<br>
2. Download data into the `data` folder from one of the following options<br>
    1. Download dataset from kaggle for early experimenting: [Global Food Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jboysen/global-food-prices)

    2. Download the data we hopefully have access to from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)
